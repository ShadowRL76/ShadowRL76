**'Ethical Hacktivist (Developer/Ethical Hacker/Content Creator)'

I'm a high school senior with a passion for programming, ethical hacking, and networking. My goal is to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science and become a network engineer, providing me with versatility in the IT field. I enjoy building projects from scratch to tackle real-world problems and plan to share my experiences on platforms like YouTube.
